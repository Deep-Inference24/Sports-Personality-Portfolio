A dynamic, responsive athlete portfolio for Olympic Gold Medalist Neeraj Chopra. Features include scroll-triggered decimal counters, interactive career milestones, and a modern Glassmorphism UI built using Vanilla JS, CSS3, and HTML5.
# 🏎️ Neeraj Chopra: The Golden Journey

Hello! This is my first-ever web development project. I created a dedicated portfolio for India's Olympic champion, Neeraj Chopra, to showcase his achievements using modern web technologies.

## 🌟 Project Overview
I wanted to build something that wasn't just a static page but felt "alive." This website highlights Neeraj's career milestones and stats with a clean, sporty, and professional look.

## 🚀 Live Demo
You can view the live website here: [https://github.com/Deep-Inference24/Sports-Personality-Portfolio]

## ✨ Features I Implemented
* **Interactive Stats:** The numbers (like his 89.94m throw) actually count up when you scroll down to them.
* **Responsive Layout:** I made sure the site looks good whether you open it on a laptop or a mobile phone.
* **Glassmorphism Design:** I used a "frosted glass" effect for the cards to give it a modern feel.
* **Clickable Timeline:** You can click on different years to see more details about his journey.

## 🛠️ What I Used
* **HTML5:** To build the skeleton of the site.
* **CSS3:** For styling, colors, and making it mobile-friendly (Flexbox).
* **JavaScript:** To handle the scroll-based animations and counting logic.

## 🧠 What I Learned
During this project, I faced and solved a few challenges:
1. **The Scroll Problem:** I had to learn how to make JavaScript "wait" for the user to reach a section before starting the animation.
2. **Handling Decimals:** Since a javelin throw is measured in decimals, I learned how to make my counter script show two decimal places correctly.
3. **GitHub Basics:** This is my first time using GitHub for hosting and version control!
